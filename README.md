# Alejandro S치nchez Monz칩n - Assesment Clarity AI (04/06/2024)

In order to offer the most completed experience in this assessment, I would add some more information and context about the developing process.

## Selected Stack
I used **Python** because it was the main requirement of the skills test, but I decided to use **Visual Studio Code** because it is the IDE I am the most comfortable with. Visual Studio Code allows me the possibility to use some extensions like the [*Jupyter*](https://jupyter.org/) environment, which allows me to write Python code in a Jupyter notebook. For me, the fastest and easiest way to install Python and all the environment realted to data is with the technologie called [*Anadonda*](https://anaconda.org/), this tecnologie allosw me to work with the Python (**3.11.7** version) environment and some preinstalled libraries.


During the development of the assessment, I only used a library which is not included in the original environment of Python. It was [*Pandas*](https://pandas.pydata.org/). Pandas is a library that allows me to work with dataframes and includes a big ammount of new functions and elements that really made the assessment more interesting and useful. I decided to use **Pandas** because it was one of the libraries I had used the most during my past formation as a Data Specialist in the German Chamber of Commerce.

I had also commented on all the code in order to make it more readable and easier to understand. Although I think that in this case, the code is very short and easy to understand.

## Estructure of the assesment
I had followed this estructure during the development of this assesment:
- **The required part of the assesment**: building a tool to parse some data and return the information requried.
- **Voluntary alternative to the first solution given**: allow keyword entries from the user.
- **Few tests** about the functions used in this part of the skills test.
- I gave a try to the **optional part** of the assessment, pretending to implement part of the logic described in the assessment (it does not work 100% correctly, but is, in my opinion, a good try).
